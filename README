This project includes data from 2001 to November 2022, and individual data subsets that cover 2017, 2018, early 2019, 2020, 2021 and most of 2022. There are overlaps.
The ODS file (which covers 2017-2019) also includes which chain each restaurant is believed to belong to. This was coded by humans.
There are jupyter notebooks and associated outputs and inputs for:
- Data wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis on longitudinal data
- Exploratory data analysis on geography
- Exploratory data analysis on textual analysis
- Exploratory data analysis on aggregation by chain respectively
- Modeling of a restaurant failure prediction model
- Modeling of a health infraction prediction model
