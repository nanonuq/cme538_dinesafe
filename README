Currently this project just includes unmodified datasets from 2019 and 2022. This data should cover 2017, 2018, early 2019, 2020, 2021 and most of 2022. There are overlaps.
The ODS file (which covers 2017-2019) also includes which chain each restaurant is believed to belong to. This was coded by humans.
Data wrangling steps to take:
1) Merge datasets and remove duplicates
2) Assign new restaurants to chains if necessary
3) Check for errors
